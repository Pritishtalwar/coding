    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am Pritish Talwar, a second-year B.E. Computer Science and Engineering student at Chitkara University. Passionate about technology, I am deeply interested in software development, data structures and algorithms, and full-stack web development. I constantly strive to improve my skills and explore new fields like finance, trading, and entrepreneurship. I am actively involved in projects related to both academics and real-world applications and also contribute to my family's SG Iron casting manufacturing business. Apart from academics, I focus on fitness, personal growth, and maintaining a disciplined lifestyle to build a successful future. I believe in balancing creativity, logic, and hustle in everything I pursue.</p>
