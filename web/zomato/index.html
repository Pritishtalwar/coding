        Zomato (/zoʊˈmæˈtoʊ/ or /zoʊˈmɑːˈtoʊ/)[3] is an Indian online food ordering and delivery service owned by Eternal Limited. Created in 2008 by Deepinder Goyal and Pankaj Chaddah, it began as a restaurant aggregator, providing menu information, user reviews, and recommendations, and expanding to more than 20 countries.[4] In 2015, Zomato entered the food delivery market in India, which soon after became its core business. As of 2023, it provides food delivery and table reservation options in more than 800 Indian cities, and restaurant discovery services in the UAE.[5]

History
Early years (2008–2010)
On 10 July 2008, Deepinder Goyal and Pankaj Chaddah launched a restaurant-listing website named FoodieBay, while working at Bain & Company. They quit their jobs in November 2009 to focus on the website full-time, and incorporated the company on 18 January 2010 as DC Foodiebay Online Services Private Limited.[6][7] In November 2010, the website was renamed Zomato as they were unsure if they would "just stick to food" and to avoid a potential naming conflict with eBay.[6][8] A mobile app for Zomato was released the following month.[9]

Expansion (2011–2015)

Availability of Zomato in 2015
With the introduction of .xxx domains in 2011, Zomato also launched zomato.xxx, a site dedicated to food porn.[10] Later in 2011, Zomato introduced online ticketing for events on its website.[11]

In 2011, Zomato expanded across India to Delhi NCR, Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, Pune, Ahmedabad and Hyderabad.[12] In 2012, it expanded operations internationally in several countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Sri Lanka,[13] Qatar,[14] the United Kingdom,[15] the Philippines,[14] and South Africa.[16] In 2013, it expanded to New Zealand,[17] Turkey, Brazil, and Indonesia, with websites and apps available in Turkish, Portuguese, Indonesian, and English languages.[18] In April 2014, it was launched in Chile and Portugal, which was followed by launches in Canada, Lebanon, and Ireland in 2015.[19][20][21]

In January 2015, Zomato acquired Seattle-based restaurant discovery portal Urbanspoon, which led to the firm's entry into the United States and Australia.[22] This U.S. expansion brought Zomato into direct competition with similar models such as Yelp and Foursquare.[22] In June 2015, Zomato announced the closure of Urbanspoon, with its traffic being redirected to Zomato.[23]</p>
